The preprocessing of data was done \n              with <strong>Python</strong> and the clustering was done with <strong>R</strong>. During the end of his time at UMBC, he presented his data at a school event. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Scott was part of \"UMBC Rockets and More\", a club about doing fun things with science with a focus on Rockets.
